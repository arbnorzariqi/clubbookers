          "description": "With its debut in the Mayfair high-end clubbing scene in September 2019, LUXX CLUB London has garnered the respect of being one of the leading nightclubs in the city. The nightclub venue is known for its throbbing light show theme. The concept was introduced into the club by Luca Maggiora.
        
        The classic venue is situated on the popular Berkeley Street along with Mayfair. It serves to be one of the most happening clubbing destinations in London. The overall theme followed at LUXX CLUB London is all about light. As you enter the club, the grand staircase takes you up through red cascading lights. The walls of the venue are amplified with the help of moving light boards featuring retro-style video games and interactive LED imagery.
        
        Inside the clubbing venue, you are surrounded by the abundance of both horizontal as well as vertical neon strip lights. There is the presence of a DJ booth that is centrally located and covered with LED lights as well as a huge LED board. The club is truly a large superclub in Mayfair.",
