          "description": "Since its inception in 2018, this glitzy club in the heart of Mayfair has hosted events such as Idris Elba’s birthday, the NME Awards after-party, and the launch of Plan B’s clothing line, in addition to a long list of regular Kadies Club VIP Table Bookings. Kadies Club London, which stays open until the early hours of the morning for guests to dance the night away, is quickly gaining notoriety as the place to party in the capital, or at least for ‘Londoners in the know,’ according to its Instagram page.
        
        Guests descend the staircase behind a discreet entrance on Swallow Street to a British-cum-art-deco lounge complete with checkerboard flooring, burnished copper walls, exposed brick walls, and armchairs adorned with plush cushions. Filament bulb lighting on the ceilings and walls casts a golden glow throughout the space, creating a warm and welcoming lounge atmosphere – ideal for catching up with a friend over a glass or bottle of champagne.
        The area can accommodate up to 170 people standing or 90 people seated, and it has a Funktion-1 sound system, two Nexus mixers, and the ability to organize catered events if necessary.
        
        From the interior to the bottle service, to the uniform detail, Kadie’s Club radiates a special sense of occasion and undeniably, the element of surprise. Prepare to be surprised, whether you’re a returning visitor or a newcomer.",
