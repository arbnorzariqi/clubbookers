          "description": "fabric London unveiled its doors on 21st October 1999. However, the idea of the club had started several years before itself. The venue of the club itself took around 3 years to get completed. Currently, fabric London stands proudly in the renovated area of the Metropolitan Cold Stores in the heart of the city.
        
        fabric is a concept that is the result of clubbers and clubbing enthusiasts. The club features three separate rooms. Out of these, two rooms in the club feature lavish stages for delivering live acts. Every room in the club has its own cutting-edge sound system. In addition to high-end sound systems, fabric also features a vibrating dance floor in the first room. It is known as the ‘bodysonic’ dance floor. Some sections of the floor have been attached to 450 bass transducers emitting bass frequencies.
        
        Therefore, clubbers can feel the intense beats of the music through their feet. The entire club is spread out across an area of around 25,000 square feet. Standard mixers, such as orange juice, cranberry juice, soda water, and a variety of sodas, are included free of charge with fabric’s bottle service. Bottles of water are available for purchase, but they must be purchased in advance. You can also buy additional mixers, such as Red Bulls and other energy drinks or premium mixers.",
