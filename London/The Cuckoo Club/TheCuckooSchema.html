          "description": "The Cuckoo Club London may look just like any other regular club in the city, but what sets it apart from the rest is its unbridled 5,000 square feet of a venue that converts from a fine dining venue to a full-scale club after 11 PM. The club is also envied because of its plush interior, 2 magnificently designed floors to accommodate large numbers of guests, and its world-class mixologists. Colors of pink and purple lights fill the club each night to complete the chic environment the club is going for. The club easily transforms from a classic restaurant to a more modern and chic nightclub after the hour of 11 and those who have been to The Cuckoo Club can give you more than enough good reasons as to why it is considered the best nightclub in London.",
