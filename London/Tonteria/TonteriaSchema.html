          "description": "Fire eating women, live wrestling, and drinks delivered by a miniature toy train right in your table. These are some of the outlandish and crazy experiences you’ll get when you decide to go to Tonteria London, one of Chelsea’s most visited nightclub. Tonteria means “nonsense” in Spanish, so expect some silly Mexican Tequila fun combined with the glamour that the area of Chelsea brings.
        
        Owned and managed by the royal brothers’ best friend, Guy Pelly, you can expect a lot of celebrities and royals gracing the club. Kate Middleton and sister Pippa have been regularly seen frequenting the club, same with Henry Cavill and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
