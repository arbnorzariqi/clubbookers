          "description": "The Windmill Soho London provides a new dimension to immersive theatre. This is ‘dinner and a show’ for the here and now. Once a 320-seater theatre that presented nude tableaux vivants and the likes of Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles, The Windmill was notably maintained open throughout the Second World War by original proprietor Laura Henderson.
        
        The venue closed momentarily in 2018 and was reincarnated as The Windmill Soho, the venue opened its legendary doors once more in July 2021. The 350-capacity facility boasts a main stage encircled by a ground-floor eating area and overseen by an upper bar that serves unique cocktails and meals courtesy of its executive chef. You may arrange a theatrical dinner experience, presenting stunning never-seen-before performances alongside an immersive dining menu devised by Michelin-starred Chef Andrew Mcleish and a unique cocktail selection by acclaimed mixologist Andy Mil. It’s eating in Soho as you’ve never seen it before.
        
        Set over three levels the newly restored establishment will contain The Theatre, which will operate as the main diner, The Palais De Luxe, a big upper bar, and The Royal Box, a spectacular private room. Outside, of course, The Windmill’s famous neon sign will continue to soar above the street.
        
        The Windmill Soho is a top club that provides the glitter, glamour, and over-the-top excitement of London. If you are up for a spectacular night, organize your evening smartly and include The Windmill Soho at the top of your list.",
