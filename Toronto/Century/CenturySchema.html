The club has recently undergone a rebranding effort, transforming from Everleigh to a full-fledged nightclub that offers a unique and luxurious clubbing experience. The club is still run by its original owners, and they have made sure to incorporate the latest advancements in technology, including a new sound system and state-of-the-art nightclub lighting that set it apart from other nightclubs in the area.
        
        Upon entering Century patrons are led into a large hall with mirrors and red LED lighting which serves as a prelude to the main area of the club. The main area of the club is characterized by dark and moody pink lighting that gives it a distinct Toronto nightclub vibe, reminiscent of high-profile clubs in Miami and Las Vegas.
        
        At the back of the club, patrons will find the bathrooms and a smoking area. Century Toronto is located in the dynamic King West area, which is known for its award-winning cafés, restaurants, extravagant shops, and luxury penthouses. The club is a popular destination for private events, international DJs, and celebrity gatherings. The club is a luxurious and fun venue that appeals to a wide range of demographics, and it is a must-visit destination for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable party experience in Toronto.
