          "description": "Dubbed as the King of Clubs, XS Las Vegas has 40,000 square feet of luxurious indoor and outdoor space which never fails to amaze partygoers. Who wouldn’t be with executive vice president of design for Wynn Design and Developments Roger Thomas’ concept of getting inspiration from the provocative curves of the human body. The venue, with over 10,000 individual light sources, majestically massive chandeliers, and floor lamps in rich gold, black and bronze are definitely the epitome of glitz and glamour.
        
        XS Las Vegas was voted as No. 1 in the Nightclub and Bar Top 100 during its first year of operations and one of the hottest spots in Las Vegas on the succeeding years. Expect the venue to be busy on Fridays and Saturdays. Dance to EDM (Electronic Dance Music) or house music that DJs play in their mirrored mosaics and crocodile-embossed booths. They set the mood for a great night with your friends.",
