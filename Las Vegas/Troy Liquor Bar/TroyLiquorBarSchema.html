The drink prices in my opinion were average but at least cheaper than the mega clubs on the strip. I like that it’s got a balcony that overlooks Fremont Street Experience. Was a little surprised that there wasn’t more people there than there was especially since there was no cover charge when I went which is always nice but of course Halloween was on a Monday night which shouldn’t of been a surprise to me that it wasn’t packed. I think its still definitely a place worth checking out when your on Fremont Street to party",
