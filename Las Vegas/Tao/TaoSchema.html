          "description": "Tao Las Vegas is a nightclub, restaurant, pool party lounge – take your pick! This club is a multi-faceted venue, an all-in-one place to explore, see and be seen. Upon entering the club, you would definitely notice Tao’s attention to detail. Walk into its hallway and you will witness exotic girls lounging and dancing in oversized tubs filled with rose petals. Head up the stairs, past some huge Buddhas and walk into an energetic party where you’ll see a decorative abacus and the hottest go-go dancers enjoying the mix of Top 40, House and Hip-Hop music on the dance floor.
        
        It is a place with 2 main rooms that can hold 2,500 patrons so twice the party, the fun, music and experience for everyone. It also has an outside terrace overlooking the Strip as well as Tao Beach which can be used as an alternative to the dance floor, who wouldn’t want to join in this vibrant happening place? Tao Las Vegas has paired with an Asian bistro restaurant and a lounge.",
