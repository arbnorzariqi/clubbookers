          "description": "The famous beach club is situated on the 11th floor of The Cromwell. The clubbing area resides over one of the busiest intersections in the city. During the daytime, Drais beach club Las Vegas features amazing pool parties for unparalleled fun. As evening turns up, the beach club gets converted into a happening nightclub destination.
        
         
        
        The day club is known to highlight the views that face north –like the Red Rock Mountains towards its west. One can also spot the Bellagio Fountains right across the street. At the beach club, there is the presence of the central pool that is highlighted by several palm trees all around. You can also come across the lavish cabanas on the second floor featuring pink curtains and LED TVs.
        
         
        
        The nightclub at the venue is available as an indoor space of two stories. Drai’s nightclub faces the pool area of the beach club. The nightclub has the presence of shiny, semi-circular black booths along with a horseshoe DJ station featuring stamp-sized mirrors.
        
         
        
        The nightclub at the destination also features as many as 7 control table operators. This is situated just behind the DJ area for delivering unparalleled visuals on the video wall of 270 degrees wrap-around feature.",
