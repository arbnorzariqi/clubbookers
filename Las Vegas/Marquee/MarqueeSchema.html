The magnificent venue designed by David Rockwell and custom visuals by V Squared Labs are great sights to behold. The live VJ controlling content on a 40-foot LED wall and choreographed costumed performers courtesy of artistic director Genevieve Cleary are enough attractions for the club goers to come back for more.",

The back tables in the Main room can be availed for $2,000 to $3,000 depending on the night’s performer. For big parties, it is better to avail a table service in the patio or Marquee’s other rooms. Try the Boom Box Room, the most economical choice since it can be availed for as low as $500, and the other option is the Library. The Boom Box Room usually plays hip hop music while the Library, with its pool table, is perfect for a discreet VIP lounge vibe."
