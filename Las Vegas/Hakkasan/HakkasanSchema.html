The music was amazing and so were the lights. You can’t sit down and the water is $27 but that’s what happens when you go to a really nice night club. They’ll take you up to the top level with EDM which is great but don’t be fooled— we didn’t realize until we were leaving that there were FOUR floors of clubs. Hip hop, country, etc. make sure you check them all out while you’re there and explore around! So fun and would definitely go again.",
