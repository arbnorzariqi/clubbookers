The pool was FREE. The water might not have been heated, but it was the perfect temperature. The bartenders were friendly and entertaining. Parking was also FREE and it was easy pulling into the self parking garage. I hadn’t been in the Sahara for years,but now I intend to check out the bars and restaurants. Saving 12 dollars in parking is like getting a free beer at the other hotels",
