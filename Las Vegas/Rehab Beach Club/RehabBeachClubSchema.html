          "description": "Quite ironic to the name, the Rehab Beach Club Las Vegas is not some relaxing place. On the contrary, it is somewhere you can expect lots of loud music and endless drinks. The big attraction of the club is, of course, the sprawling swimming pool where you can stand & dance around with a bunch of other people or groups. As far as VIP treatment in the Rehab Beach Club is concerned, there are multiple levels of cabanas that are available here. There are different levels of seclusions and amazing views of the main pool area. The luxurious Rehab Beach Club features as many as 40 Tahitian-style lavish cabanas that are complete with a 42-inch plasma HD TV, personal misting system, telephone, refrigerator, and a separate safe.
        
        
        
        Selected as “The Top 10 Pools” in the world by the Travel Channel, the Rehab Beach Club in Las Vegas is the pinnacle of poolside relaxation and entertainment. Offering an exciting adult beach club experience, the Rehab Beach Club is your go-to destination.",
