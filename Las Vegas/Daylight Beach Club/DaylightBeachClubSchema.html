There are lots of rules to follow and expensive drinks, but that’s expected at a place like this and honestly the rules can be useful. We got a table and the service was great. Water was warm…maybe too warm…but enough to cool off and have a great time. Perfect way to get the day going so you can gamble irresponsibly at night!",
