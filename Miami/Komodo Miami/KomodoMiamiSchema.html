The first thing you notice when you enter the restaurant is all the crispy Peking duck hanging in the front window. The restaurant was busy but organized. The food was flavourful and great for sharing. We enjoyed the different dishes but highly recommend the Peking duck tacos as they appear to be a specialty.
