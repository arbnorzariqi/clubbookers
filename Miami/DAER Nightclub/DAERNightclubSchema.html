We had purchased our tickets ahead of time. We got to the club a little before midnight and there was no line. This should had been the first red flag that the club was going to be empty. We waited for an hour till 1:15 to decide to bail. I was disappointed because I thought it was going to be like LIV or Story in Miami. The dance floor didn’t even get full.
