          "description": "Calling all saints and sinners to this wonderful nightclub that sits right Taqueria 1620 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33135, United States. Experience an exceptional visit with ultimate food and drinks at El Santo Miami, a tequila speakeasy.
        
        This wonderful restaurant embraces the vivid celebration of Lucha Libre culture and the comfort of Mexican cuisine in its ideal form. With a delightful menu of shareable platters highlighting Asian, Peruvian, and Latin influences, there’s a lot that El Santo offers to its guests.
        
        Leading into a huge wooden dwelling house with plantation at the front doors into the dining area seems like walking into a deserted chapel that’s now been renovated as a chic ode to cocktails and lively dining. A lounge is equipped with cushy leather-studded lounges with an archaic church keyboard serving as the DJ booth. The regular 80-seat dining area allows banquette seats under a grotto-like roof with hanging vines and greenery. El Santo Miami’s intimate private dine-in space is established within red velvet drapes, proposing both neighborhood staple and nightlife destinations.
        
        Book your table today to enjoy musical performances and live entertainment throughout the evening.",
