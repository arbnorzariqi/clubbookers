          "description": "Step inside the lively club of Basement Miami and dance like there’s no tomorrow. It’s time to bring out your party attitude and dance like nobody’s watching. Basement Miami was developed by the legendary Ian Schrager of Studio 54, where you listen to the lineup created by NYC nightlife impresario Nicholas Matar.
        You also get branding and vibes by Miami veteran Ben Pundole, and a lot of local swagger from Josh Wagner. If you’re tired from dancing, you can always relax with bowling and ice skating. So, be involved, express yourself, and have fun with your friends. Forget all your troubles and worries by dancing the night away.",
