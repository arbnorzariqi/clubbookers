          "description": "Gala Miami is an ultra-exclusive nightclub that offers a private high-end luxury experience to its highly selective clientele. It is located in the old Mokai space and is known for its lush decor designed by Francois Frossard, who also designed Set and Villa Azur. The Gala can be found on the famous Miami Beach at 235 23rd Street.
        
        Gala aims to transport its guests to a bygone era of imagination and fascination, creating an escape from the ordinary. The club has a serious club cred, having been brought to us by hospitality/event planning veterans Jojo Lahoud and Mo Garcia. Gala is also known for its caviar bumps, which are curated by world-renowned purveyor Marky’s. The experience is quite pricey, with bumps starting at $200 for 50 grams of the “more approachable” Kaluga Special Reserve and $1,500 for 50 grams of the ultra-rare Beluga Huso Huso. Bumps are only available on Friday and Saturday nights starting at 11 p.m. and can be reserved early for the caviar experience.
        
        Gala is highly exclusive, and the best way to gain entry is to reserve a table early for the caviar experience. Its clientele features the most famous personalities out there. There’s Drake chilling with DJ Khaled, Ne-Yo performing on the stage, and even LeBron James. Also in the mix of photos are gorgeous influencers taking selfies in the crowd and servers holding up sparklers.",
