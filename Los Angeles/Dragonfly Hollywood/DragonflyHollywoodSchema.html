The presence of a state-of-the-art L-acoustics system helps in supporting the programming of live music and DJ performances. You can also enjoy the showcase of several other events and bespoke entertainment.
        
        You can enjoy Dragonfly Hollywood bottle service and VIP table booking with professional concierge services.

Up to six people can be accommodated at most events with the Patio Ultra VIP Table For 6 option for a budget of $1,000.
