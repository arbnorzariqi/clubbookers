          "description": "The Station 1640 is a premier nightclub & Hollywood staple located in the heart of the ever-rising Cahuenga Corrido. The overall décor & theme of the Station 1640 Los Angeles is inspired by the concept of the underground subways of the world-famous New York City. As the highly celebrated nightlife scene of the club turns into the new era, the club’s venue incorporates the design elements of amazing music, art & nightlife in a contemporary way. This is achieved with the help of the all-encompassing designer & artistic touch including the most epic graffiti of the Los Angeles city.
        
        Eddie Donaldson –who is a premier figure in the graffiti community of the Los Angeles city along with GuerillaOne’s founder has been enlisted towards commissioning the top-class world-famous artists like Slick, Retna, Risk, Jim Evans, and so more. The entire installation of the entire setup will be culminating a grand opening towards celebrating the new chapter of the latest Station 1640 club in Los Angeles.",

        They do open their doors later than the time mentioned on the flyer, but the wait is worth it!
        
        There was some confusion about the tickets I purchased online, but the staff was polite and quick to resolve the issue. We do make minor errors as we are all human, but I have always been treated with respect and that’s what really counts! Would definitely recommend this place.",
