          "description": "Upon entering Playhouse Hollywood’s doors, one would feel being transported into another world. There is a Vegas-feel in this 13,00 square foot club playground with flying trapeze, aerial acrobatics and caged go-go dancers. You can also arrange to arrive in a huge limo with your friends if you want an extra VIP experience! The main attraction that makes Playhouse Hollywood a cut above the rest is their impressive staff who are not just your regular bartenders for the night, but also performers. It makes Playhouse Hollywood Los Angeles a truly fun and entertaining venue to be. Imagine being given a steamingly hot burlesque show while having your first drink or an aerialist performing above you while you are having fun in the dance floor. Definitely an amazing and energetic place to be!",
