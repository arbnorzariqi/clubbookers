          "description": "The historic and landmark building which was built in 1929, has been given a facelift, and brought back to life. The party lounge Exchange Los Angeles has taken over the former Los Angeles Stock Exchange building. The place was renovated to give way to non-stop partying, with restoration cost amounts to $ 5 million. Los Angeles clubbers now enjoy dancing to the beat of electronic music in a fabulous venue which offers original historical features, art deco characters and state-of-the-art audiovisual facilities.
        
        What used to be the trading floor is now converted into the main dance floor, the mezzanine which is known as Federal Reserve is the reservation-only section and the fourth floor is the private area or the Board Room.",
