          "description": "Warwick Los Angeles is a famous rustic lounge and a part of the renowned Hollywood club. This club was formerly referred to as the Club L. It is a warehouse revealing exposed brick, unfinished ceilings, and fireplaces. The idea of the clubbing destination is a simple one. As far as the layout can be observed, it is a space suited to both bottle and table services. The given bar program has been executed by the famous talents including Damian Windsor and Jason Bran.
        
         
        
        At the famous bar program, you can order your favorite drinks from the multiple bars. Here is how the concept of cocktail services will be working. Those who will be reserving a table will get the opportunity to score a cocktail attendant on a personal level for making drinks throughout the night. A table might be available with a freshly squeezed juice, a choice spirit, housemade bitters or syrups, housemade foams, seasonal garnishes, and so more. It would ultimately depend on the drink and fancy ice.
        
         
        
        While the venue has abundant furniture, from stools to booths, and tables, the lighting of the venue also makes it appear open & big. It stands true even when the venue is fully occupied. The interiors of the venue feature a rugged traditional look featuring comfortable leather benches and exposed wooden beams.",
