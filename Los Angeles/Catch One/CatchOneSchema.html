          "description": "The famous Nightclub Union in Los Angeles has rebranded itself as Catch One Los Angeles. Through this rebranding, the club series aims at celebrating its rich history of serving as a safe haven for the LGBTQ community of individuals in the Hollywood capital.
        
        The club had been initially launched as Jewels Catch One in 1973. It had been introduced by Jewels Thais-Williams -a famous businesswoman and LGBTQ activist. She kept Catch One open through issues related to the AIDS epidemic, racism, an arson attack, and so more. All of these instances had made attempts towards bringing down the first-ever black gay discos and clubs in the United States of America.
        
        Catch One, since its inception, is known to host the likes of famous names like Whitney Houston, Madonna, Luther Vandross, Donna Summer, Rick James, and so more. The rebranding efforts have linked the club back to its impressive history while expanding its musical palate for every night.
        
        Catch One’s table rates range from $400 to $1,200. Catch One’s typical table costs $400 per person. Most events allow you to secure a VIP Table (Small) for up to five people with a budget of $400. So, book a table here today.",
