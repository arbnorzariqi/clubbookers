          "description": "With its clear intention to attract the big international DJs and plenty of A-listers from the town, the Lure Nightclub Los Angeles is something you must visit for an intense clubbing experience. Lure is a must-visit megaclub that brings major Vegas-style glamour & glitz to the heart of Hollywood in Los Angeles. Spanning a sprawling area of massive 18,000 square feet, this high-tech nightclub in LA boasts leading DJs & amazing bottle service. Once you enter the club, you are ushered through a glittering diamond faceted façade for reaching an abstract garden of 12 massive cabanas, beautiful flower sculptures & water features.
        
        The interior space of the impressive club is designed in a white cocoon styled club & VIP area that overlooks the loft & stage area. For bringing a sense of sophistication into the club, there is the presence of some oversized suede panels located next to the LED screens that are motion-sensitive. You would be awestruck by the amazing bar’s backdrop featuring a 14’ fire sculpture. Dark mahogany floors, intricate metal designing, lace-like accents, and mosaic-style flooring are the factors that complete the overall décor of the Lure Nightclub in LA.",
