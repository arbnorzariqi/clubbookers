          "description": "The DL or Delancy is a highly sought-after rooftop clubbing destination in the heart of the city. It is an elegant rock club set on the rooftop for delivering bespoke views of the entire New York City strip. The entire venue has been divided into three separate levels. As such, there is the presence of abundant space. During the summer season, the DL Rooftop area serves to be the main attraction. Unlike several bars out there that refer to the roofs as ‘al fresco,’ the DL Rooftop in New York has a palm-fronded rooftop area.
        
        The entire rooftop area of the club has been set in the South Beach style featuring several fountains and benches. At the same time, the main floor of the clubbing area features the grotto vibe while sporting a décor with equal parts of sleek wooden slabs and exposed bricks all around. At the main floor, the DJ in the club area holds rocking events for most nights. The famous DJs of the venue play a mix of disco and rock.
        
        There is also the presence of a basement entertainment space. It is a reminiscent of the traditional Coney Island High. The music venue is equipped with an impressive sound system and also a cooler AC for maintaining the overall cool.",
