The essence of Noir New York is not always apparent at first glance; nuanced layers of detail are subtly revealed with each visit through our golden doors. Prepare to be amazed as you enter the extravaganza that only Noir NYC can offer.
        
        The venue is well known for its unique and exquisite clientele, Noir serves a unique niche, combining classic simplicity with the avant-garde of New York.
        
        Drenched in gold (a modifier we wish we could use more often), the supper club serves classic cocktails with modern twists and an elevated Asian-inspired menu in a 1920s-inspired space complete with DJ booths and chandeliers. Noir NYC has a great location, allowing for spectacular views.
        
        Plan your trip to New York now and put Noir NYC on the top of your list. A night out in Noir New York is unlike anything you have experienced before.",
