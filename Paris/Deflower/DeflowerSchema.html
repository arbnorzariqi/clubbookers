          "description": "Deflower Paris is a concept nightclub in the city. You can consider it between the concept of a nightclub and a high-end bar. The interiors of the nightclub feature unique design features and top-class amenities to enhance your clubbing experience. The interiors of the club are inspired by the style of 70s music. The entire clubbing space has areas featuring beautiful blooms and flowers. You will also be impressed with neon lighting all around. There is a separate Marshall speaker wall.
        
        The interiors of Deflower appear like a recording studio featuring a standing microphone. The studio is perfect for your bespoke photographs. Therefore, the venue is deemed as the unique clubbing destination in the capital of fashion. The seduction of clubbing continues in unique elements of the club featuring Chesterfield sofas. As you enter the venue, you will be greeted with vintage microphones tracing all your way into the club.
        
        This concept, which has yet to be heard in France, assures an unmatched succession of moments with priceless experiences that can only be found here, with hours ranging from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. There’s always time for a glass of wine or a few beers after you’ve danced yourself to tiredness!",
