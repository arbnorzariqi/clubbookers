          "description": "t is an all-new energetic nightclub in Paris. Boum Boum Paris has been given the reputation of serving as the brand-new Chez Raspoutine in Paris. The club was launched in September last year. Soon enough, it has managed to stand out as one of the most happening nightclubs in the city. Alexander Ghislain -the owner of other famous venues like the Ginger and Raspoutine, is the mastermind behind this fun-filled clubbing space.
        
        The interiors of the club have been designed by Charles Tassin. It is depicted as a highly modern and conceptual venue. The entire concept of Boum Boum focuses on the layout that is styled like an arena. Therefore, the overall focus is on lights and sounds all around. It helps in the creation of a theatrical experience to serve as the perfect backdrop for your clubbing experience.
        
        Boum Boum features high-end ceilings along with mirrored walls and glossy surfaces.
        
        While the music is mostly in the English language, DJs at the Boum Boum club don’t worry too much about genre. They play upbeat dance classics from the last several decades, including electronic and hip-hop as well as a few other genres. This is a refreshing change from other clubs, which only play French pop and hip-hop. The DJ and the crowd have a very close relationship thanks to the karaoke and large screens on the walls of this dance club.",
