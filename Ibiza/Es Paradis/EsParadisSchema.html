          "description": "Are you searching for paradise in Ibiza? Well you just got lucky! Possibly the most beautiful club on the island and as the name suggests, it offers a paradise feel to it. Es Paradis Ibiza has been a secret paradise in Ibiza since the ’70s and is one of the original charms of Ibiza’s nightlife.
        
        If you’re on holiday in Ibiza and you’re looking for the ultimate clubbing experience, Es Paradis is the one to excel in that, as it offers dazzling Ibiza Virgins and the infamous Fiesta Del Agua (Water Party). Es Paradis’ Fiesta Del Agua is one of the most iconic in Ibiza and you have to witness it to believe it. It is a ritual among young clubbers to the island, a true baptism!
        
        One of Ibiza’s oldest clubs but definitely it is a hotspot for anyone interested in water parties, spectacular decor and design and pyramid roofs. Quite unique in Ibiza, the decor is largely white and ornate. Imagine Roman columns and marble surfaces and extensive greenery. Translated from its full name: ‘Heaven On Earth’ it is with no doubt one of the island’s most spectacular venues and also a popular hangout for celebrities while they are on the island.",

The music is off the hook and the highlight/special act kicks in at 4:30AM, that’s when it starts to rain from the ceiling and the crowd goes completely crazy! The build up to it is pretty great as well.
