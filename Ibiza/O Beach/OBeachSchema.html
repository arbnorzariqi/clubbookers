        Sadly there were some issues. First we could get single drinks (cocktails), later this was denied, only jugs were allowed. For us this was a problem since half of us (2 of 4) do not drink alcohol. Also the kitchen closed at 20.00 while the website says 21.00. We were left having to finish our budget with drinks only. Only alcoholic ones were still served besides water. Not great when not everyone drinks alcohol.",
