      "description": "It’s time to relax and have fun partying with friends at Destino. Known for its open-air parties, this club resort is located on the cliff of Cap Martinet. It offers breathtaking views of Ibiza Town. Destino Pacha Ibiza Resort offers breathtaking panoramic views of the Mediterranean Sea, Dalt Vila (Ibiza’s old town) and the island of Formentera. It’s the best place if you’re looking for an unforgettable clubbing experience. Unlike other clubs where the party happens inside, Destino Ibiza allows you to dance and relax under the stars, so no worries about tight and small spaces. The club party starts at five o’clock in the afternoon and lasts until midnight.
    
    On the opposite side of the pool by the stage, there are relaxing spaces full of day beds where you can listen to the performances while having a decent conversation. If you want to see the party from above, the elevated stage is perfect for you because you have a great view of the dance floor.
    
    If you are not done with partying and want more, you can proceed to Destino’s underground nightclub, TOX, where exclusive sponsored parties are being held. Having a great time has no limits when you go clubbing in Destino.",
