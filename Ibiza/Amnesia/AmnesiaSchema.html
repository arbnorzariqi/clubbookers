          "description": "Amnesia Ibiza is one of the best clubs on the Spanish island. When you hear about Ibiza you already know what we are talking about. Endless parties, good weather, sun, beaches, a lot of blues and a great atmosphere in the air. That’s Ibiza! Now let us tell you a little bit more about Amnesia. The name of the club “amnesia” it’s a metaphor for what you are going to experience over there. Amnesia offers you different kinds of parties from Monday to Saturday that you just cannot miss!
        
        Mondays in Amnesia are for old Ibiza vibes with some of your favorite music artists and performers who will make your night unforgettable. There is a special pyramid decoration on Monday which makes a whole difference in the way how you’re going to experience Amnesia. Tuesdays are for Together in Amnesia – one of the most well known nights for DJs from all around the world. If you are a Foam Party fan you can enjoy it every Wednesday night with the residents Caal and Les Schmitz. From May to October, every Friday in Amnesia is for Music On Event. Save the night for Marco Carola and you will not regret it! Opening Party and Elrow Party are expecting you on Saturdays.",
