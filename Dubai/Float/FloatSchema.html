          "description": "The Float Dubai is a unique clubbing experience because you will be partying on an ocean liner. The club is on the retired Queen Elizabeth II, a famous ocean liner that is now the Float Dubai’s home. At this club, you will get the chance to party with celebrities and enjoy tracks played by some of the best DJs in town.
        
        If you plan to party at the Float, you must get your friends together, opt for Float Dubai Nightclub bottle service and VIP table booking. It will ensure that you skip the lines and get the best-in-class VIP treatment throughout the evening. You do not have to worry about ordering the drinks as these will be served directly to your table.
        
        Free mixers like orange juice, cranberry juice, soda water, and other sodas are included in the bottle service here at Float. Bottles of water are available for purchase, but they must be purchased in advance. You can also buy additional mixers, such as Red Bulls and other energy drinks or premium mixers.
        
        If you want to sit where you want, you’ll have to wait till you arrive. Arrive early to enhance your chances of securing a better table!",
