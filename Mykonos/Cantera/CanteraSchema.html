Cantera Mykonos serves to be one of the best fusion restaurants in the entire city.
        
        Cantera is situated on the seashore of the renowned Little Venice. The classic venue of the restaurant offers bespoke views of the majestic windmills across the sea. Moreover, the place is also famous for offering scenic views of the breathtaking Mykonian sunsets. You can enjoy your favorite meals here as you watch the magical sunset across the horizons of the sea. The exclusive Cantera Sushi Meat Restaurant in Mykonos is the perfect place to unwind yourself in the heart of the city.",
