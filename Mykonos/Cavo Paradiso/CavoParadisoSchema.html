          "description": "Referred to as one of the best summer clubs in Europe, the Cavo Paradiso nightclub in Mykonos has been organizing some of the best-ever dance music nights for over 20 years. The club has been the brainchild of its owner named Nikos Daktylides. He has the vision of creating a clubbing venue that was far from the busy party town of Mykonos. Thus, by taking advantage of the natural beauty of the mesmerizing sea, the owner came up with the innovative idea of designing this heavenly place in Mykonos. The club is known for its amazing look of the Aegean Sea ahead and boasts spectacular bars across two levels of the club.
        
         
        
        To top it all, the club also consists of a separate terrace area that offers breathtaking views of the sea ahead. There is also a unique pool at its terrace that has been shaped as the town of Mykonos. If you are looking for some top-class clubbing experience –away from the hustle of the city, then Cavo Paradiso nightclub in Mykonos is a perfect destination for you.",
