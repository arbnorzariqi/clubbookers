Their thematic nights are a lot of fun and the atmosphere as well as the interior design of the place are just great. Due to the strict face control the people that enter are also fine (not shady or overly intoxicated) which contributes to the pleasant experience. Keep in mind the dress code though! Last time a friend of mine was almost turned down for wearing a sports jacket",
