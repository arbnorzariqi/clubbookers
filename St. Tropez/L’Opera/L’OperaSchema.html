          "description": "L’Opera St. Tropez serves to be an exciting place for fun & entertainment. It is built in the shape of an arena and is situated in the heart of the beautiful St. Tropez village. The charming terrace area of the club allows you to have breathtaking views of the entire old town, churches, old houses, and charming yachts. While the exteriors are breathtaking, the interiors of the place turn out to be enormous and elegant. There is the presence of oversized lights and vases. Moreover, there is also a shaped bar that is covered with mirrors –just like in opera.
        The interiors of the nightclub are colored in white & gold to enhance the look. You can also come across contemporary, extravagant paintings on the premises. As it turns dark, L’Opera turns into a happening nightclub destination drawing the attention of clubbing folks from all over. It is one of the most fun places to be in L’Opera –featuring violin players, exotic dancers, flame throwers, and so more to entertain you. You can also come across famous resident DJs who keep spinning the beats into the late hours of the night.",
