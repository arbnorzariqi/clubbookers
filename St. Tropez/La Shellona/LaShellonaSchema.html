          "description": "Situated in Ramatuelle, La Shellona Saint Tropez is one of the most sought-after beach clubs in the city. The beach club made its debut on the dazzling Shell Beach in the year 2017. It serves to be a top-class partnership with the renowned Ce La Vi Beach Club in the city. The entire décor of the beach club features the presence of impressive teak floors and beautiful canvas décor. The striking beach-themed décor of the beach club is sprawling out along Pampelonne Beach.
        
        La Shellona St Tropez brings out the Bohemian style to the existing terrace décor of the venue. Moreover, there is the presence of oceanfront dining rooms –just inches away from the sea. Therefore, you can enjoy bespoke views of the ocean as you dine at this high-end restaurant. Quite typical of Mykonos and Ibiza, La Shellona St Tropez offers access to a lively lunch scene along with late-night dinner sessions that serve as the best alternative to Nikki Beach post 7pm.
        
        The destination is regarded as the perfect getaway destination for late lunches lingering into breathtaking sunsets. La Shelonna St Tropez brings on the true flavors of Greece to Saint Tropez to match the party scene of Mykonos.",
