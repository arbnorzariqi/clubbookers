          "description": "Loulou St. Tropez is one of the latest venues that has been opened on Pampelonne Beach. The beach resort has been designed to serve as an homage to the bohemian River during the time of the 1950s. There is a dash of the Parisian joie de vivre.
        The clubbing destination has been designed to serve as the summer quarters of the highly sought-after Loulou Restaurant. The venue is known to bring forth the urban glamor of Paris right to the ambiance of St. Tropez.
        Loulou is known to sit on the famous Pampelonne Beach. The venue was brought to attention by the film by Brigitte Bardot. The overall style and ambiance deliver a laid-back sophistication from the period of the French Riviera from the time of the 1950s. The beach area has been backed by wild vegetation and dunes. The beach area has been famed for its overall natural beauty. The area of the beach remains accessible to those who are visiting the coast on the superyacht charter.
        
        Once you are on the shore, you can sit on the lounger while getting access to unparalleled views of the famous Mediterranean. You can stay at the restaurant or the club for lunch.",
